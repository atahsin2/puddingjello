Q) How to get Python libraries?

You need to install them. Check install instructions for each library.
Usually, the python package manager (pip3) can be used to install things.
e.g.: pip3 install --user --upgrade pandas

Q) How to organize my dependencies?

Most projects come with a `requirements.txt` file that contains the list
of libraries that project depends on. To install all of those dependencies,
you can provide that file to pip3.
e.g. pip3 install --user --upgrade -r requirements.txt
